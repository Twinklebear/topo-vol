# Topo-Vol

Topo-Vol is a topology guided volume exploration and analysis tool, written for
the final project in
[Bei Wang's Computational Topology Course](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~beiwang/teaching/cs6170-spring-2017/schedule.html).
It is built on top of the [Topology ToolKit](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/) and
[VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) for computation, and uses
[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and a custom rendering system for the UI and volume rendering.
